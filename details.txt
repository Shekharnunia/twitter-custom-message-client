Great. So I'll install a program with one click on my computer. It will run all the time. Once a week it will send a message to my new followers for the past 7 days. This will be sent automatically. I can change the message. And also once a month I can manually send out a message to each list. I can change this message. And once a week whenever certain words are mentioned in a tweet I will get an email with a link to the tweet. Is that all clear?

1.Can you check who my new followers are once a week and then send them a message?
2. Can you send a message to people on certain lists I have?
3. Can you notify me once a week when a tweet has certain words in it?
